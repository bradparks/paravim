Paravim (or pvim) is an editor for Nim powered by Vim (via [libvim](https://github.com/paranim/libvim)) and rendered in OpenGL (via [paranim](https://github.com/paranim/paranim)). It is very alpha right now, and doesn't include Nim-specific features yet, like syntax highlighting or code completion. Stay tuned...
